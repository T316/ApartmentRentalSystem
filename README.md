# Apartment Rental System

## System Requirements – Apartment Rental Brokers

Design a system in which brokers can publish their apartments for rent.
Each apartment ad must contain neighborhood, floor, category, image and price per
month. Categories have a description and must be one of the following - one-room apartment, 
two-room apartment, three-room apartment, penthouse. Additionally, each apartment should
list the following options: with or without parking, with or without basement and
heating type.

The system should allow users to filter the apartments by category, neighborhood and
price range anonymously. Ads can be sorted by neighborhood or by price.
When a user chooses a apartment, he needs to call the broker on the provided phone
and make the arrangement. The broker then needs to edit the apartment ad as
“currently unavailable” manually. The system must not show the unavailable
apartments.
